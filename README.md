# Welcome to My Laboratory/Restaurant           
I need a space to mark down my scattered imagination for integration in the future.         

## My Github        
When you create a CNAME file and then post your Github blog to the public website, you would have two methods to create an admitted path for visitors to read your individual blog.= visitors could have two available paths to read your individual blog.           
        
One available path is the url generated by the system attached with the step that you created the CNAME file. This is a normal and holonomic process, in which the url would open the whole repository firstly and present a page with the kernel based on the information you editted in the README file. And the layout and the theme of this page would depend on _ _config.yml_ file. The advantage of this method is the decoration. But the disadvantage is that when I add a picture to the README file obeying the markdown grammar, the picture could not be loaded in the page attached with the url, though it can be shown in the README file. Only with the base64 code of the picture embedded into README file can the picture be shown in the final page (curiously we cannot load the picture in the README file when we use the base64 code). But as you know,
